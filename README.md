# EIT-EBM

## Data creation:
1. PrepareData_single.m operates in single mode and creates only 1 body with user-selected anomaly conductvity and location.
2. PrepareData_multi.m operates in multi mode and creates multiple bodies with randomly-selected anomaly conductvities and locations. This is useful for ML based training regimes.

## EBM prior training

## Forward problem solving

## Inverse problem solving

## Joint training
